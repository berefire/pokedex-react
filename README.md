# README to run Pokédex

In this project, I learned to use Axios and to easily style components with the SASS tool.
To obtain Pokémon data, this page is using PokéApi, a RESTful Pokémon Api (link: https://pokeapi.co/).
In terminal, to run Pokédex, first clone the repository and install nodejs:

- cd pokedex-react (enter the directory where the project is located.)
- npm i
- npm run dev

In the browser, write the url:  http://localhost:5173/
In the HomePage, you will see a list of 15 Pokémon and a navigation bar. In the search bar, you can search for Pokémon 
by typing their name.
